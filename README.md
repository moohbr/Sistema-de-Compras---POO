We have the following data from an online store system that failed during validation in processing purchase orders made by users.

Develop a system to validate valid purchases made, check that at the time of purchase:

 - If the buyer had an available balance in the wallet.
 - The store had the quantity of the product in stock.
 - The system must count invalid purchases, per user, and how many people were affected.
